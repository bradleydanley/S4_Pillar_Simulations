# S4_Pillar_Simulations
Data_Utils file:
  Has utility functions for the simulation. Can import things that save your data to a csv, and make different plots from csv or plot the geometry of a simulation. 

optimized_simulation:
  Contains the code to run a 2x2 grid of pillars under wavelength ranges from 3-5. The period size is 2.7u, with radii sizes ranging from 10%-90% of period size. Returns the transmission and reflection values from the experiment.
